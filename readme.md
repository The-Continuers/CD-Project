# Compiler project

## Introduction
A project with not too much scalability, but more of a hard problem, rather be called a dragon among the CS community. Besides its hard problems, it needs too much global testing for any changes, so that a feature doesn't act like a bug for other parts of the problem.

## Features
mostly any feature a language like Cpp has, has been implemented, except the Object-Orientation feature.

## Significance
as you may know, there are routine and non-routine parts in a compiler. 
### Routine
Scanning and Parsing the language, is the routine part. You just have to watch over the language Grammar, and extract the LALR(1) grammar and also the tokens. The code part is implemented under a library.
### Non-Routine
The code-generation part, is the non-routine part. We didn't see others' works. We just get inspired by the course, and implemented every part by ourselves. So, it's something new.
